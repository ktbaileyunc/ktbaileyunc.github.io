Since January 2023, I've been a data reporter for [The Daily Tar Heel](https://www.dailytarheel.com), UNC's independent student newspaper. I primarily work with DTH writers and editors who want to add some sort of data component to their stories. I try to make my visualizations informative, accessible, and pretty — it can be a tricky balance, but I've learned a lot since starting. I was also recently promoted to become one of the DTH's first senior data reporters; I'm currently in the process of assembling my first investigative data story.

### Some of my visualizations:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/accessibility.png" alt="Data visualization for housing accessibility story." caption="I used ArcGIS to put together this map showing which UNC dorms don't have elevators — just one example of how UNC lags in accessibility. The visualization was part of the DTH's annual housing issue." %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/wetlands.png" alt="Data visualization for wetlands story." caption="This map shows North Carolina's wetlands, many of which recently lost federal protection and now stand to be developed. I made this visualization using QGIS from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service data. [[Article]](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/09/city-north-carolina-wetlands-farm-bill-environmental-impacts)" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/campaign.png" alt="Bar chart showing campaign contributions in Chapel Hill municipal races." caption="I made this chart using the campaign finance reports that candidates are required to file to the NC State Board of Elections. [[Article]](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/10/city-campaign-finance-early-october-chapel-hill-town-council-mayor-carrboro-chccss-adam-searing-jess-anderson)" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bookcosts.png" alt="Data visualization for textbook price story." caption="I created this visualization from Consumer Price Index data to show increases in textbook prices over the past several years. This was part of our welcome-back issue. [[Article]](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/08/university-inflation-impacts-update)" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/firearms.png" alt="Data visualization for firearm-related child deaths." caption="I made this chart to summarize data released by the NC Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. [[Article]](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/03/city-child-fatality-task-force-feb-update)" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/sexualassault.png" alt="Data visualization for sexual assault story." caption="This visualization is part of the final installment of a DTH series examining UNC Police crime-log data. [[Article]](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/04/university-sexual-assault-crime-log-data-unc-chapel-hill)" %}


If you've made it this far, I've also written for The Daily Tar Heel. Well, so far, I have [exactly one byline](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/06/city-chapel-hill-carrboro-pride-preview) to my name. [My favorite story](https://thechoatenews.choate.edu/2022/04/02/choates-radio-station-its-dead-air-from-here/) I've written was for my high school's newspaper; it was about our now-defunct radio station. I liked writing it so much that I joined the college radio station once I got to UNC.
