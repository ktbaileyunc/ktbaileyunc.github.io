Hi there! I'm a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying computer science and philosophy. In short, I'm passionate about doing good things with technology. I hope to use software engineering and data analysis to build tools that benefit the communities I care about.

My work as a data reporter for The Daily Tar Heel has given me a taste of what it feels like to turn numbers into something that brings new insights to readers. Last summer, I interned at SAS, where I learned, among other things, what it's like to work on a small team at a large company.

I'm originally from Charlotte, NC, and I graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, CT. In my free time, you can often find me watching C-SPAN, snapping blurry film photos, or reading albums' liner notes at my college radio station.
